{file name - full path}
{file last modification since last index}
{list of all file the header file is included in (example: {source}:{pos})
the record also includes what position the file was last located in so we can verify
though this is by default ignored and instead we only check the top of the file
till the first function/class/struct all separated by ","}
$ -  mark end 

I know this might be a bit stupid but custom file formats
are just better and Im planing on writing numbers as bytes
thus complicating my life but at least I'll be able to speed
up writing and reading/converting/whatever makes sense to me
